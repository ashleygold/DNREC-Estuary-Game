# Section-010-Team-4

A Java project that teaches middle school students about estuary conservation in a fun and exciting way. 

## How To Run

All three games are controlled by the main game package, which contains the main method. Each game has three packages representing MVC.
The main menu in the main controller package has to be run as a Java Application. That contains all other controllers, so there is no need
to run them separately.

## Maze

In Group 4’s first minigame, the player’s main objective is to navigate a maze to get to the estuary which has the lowest level of salinity while eating all the food on the screen to grow bigger and stronger. The first thing the player sees is a tutorial on how to play the game. In it, the player eats all the food and continues to first level. In the first stage, the salinity bar is full, the second and third stages have decreased salinity levels. As the player navigates the maze, they need to avoid predators. If the player hits a predator, they restart the stage. If the player continues to lose by hitting a predator, the game gets easier by removing predators. Kids will enjoy this game because it is an addicting pac-man styled game.

## Shore Defense

In the second game, the player is a crab whose goal is to protect the shore from destruction by waves. The waves are made by one of three types of boats, sailboats, speedboats, and cruise liners. These waves hit the shore from different directions due to wind; however the player can help protect the shore by placing oyster gabions, sea grass and walls along the shoreline. Turtles also come up on the screen and need to make it to the ocean. The player will learn that the grass is more preferable to walls and gabions because turtles can walk through them so they don’t hard to the environment. The goal is to ensure that all turtles make it to see for two whole minutes while making sure no part of the shore is completely eroded. 

## StoryCubes

In our story cube game, the player rolls a random number of cubes with images on them.  The player orders the images and the game will prompt the player to enter a story.  There is a wide range of possible images which the player can use to write a story using what she or he has learned about estuaries.  The game then displays the story and it is saved to an external file for other uses.
